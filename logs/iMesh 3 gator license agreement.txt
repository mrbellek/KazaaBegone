Gator.com Privacy Statement and End User License Agreement

 --- Gator.com Privacy Statement ---

Here's the deal. And why it is a win-win opportunity. 
You get: free Gator.com and third party services and software applications that make it faster and easier to perform online activities such as filling in registration and order forms, remembering passwords and saving money while shopping. 

We get: the chance to occasionally show you special offers and advertisements that are selected to match your interests and to bring you useful desktop software applications and services that we think might make your internet experience more enjoyable. We determine your interests by collecting information about where you surf and shop on the web. For example, if you visit a recipe site we might display a special offer or advertisement for cookware. Depending on which services and applications you use, as well as your preferences, these special offers and advertisements may be displayed using various size pop-up windows on web pages you visit, and/or sent to you via electronic mail. 

The money we earn from our advertisers and business associates allows us to provide these applications and services to you for free. 

Basic stuff we need to know about you. And why we need it. 
- Gator ServWareApps pay attention to where you are on the web in order to know when to offer assistance (e.g., automatically recognizing and offering to help fill out forms that appear in your browser) as well as to create a profile that is used to select and deliver special offers and advertisements that we think might be of interest to you. This profile is stored on Gator.com servers and consists of: 
- Your email address, first name, country and ZIP code (limited to first 5 digits in the U.S.) 
- Your Gator.com ID which is a numeric identifier that is generated by Gator.com when you receive Gator ServWareApps 
- Your master Gator password, if you choose to use one (we store this so we can share it with you if you happen to forget it) 
- Information about web pages you visit -- this information includes a site's web address, time spent at a site, transaction activity, where Gator ServWareApps were used, site entry and exit patterns, and some products and information viewed 
- Any optional demographic information you choose to provide us such as gender and income 
- History of various special offers and advertising delivered by Gator ServWareApps, and your various responses to them 
- Standard web log information and system settings such as user IP addresses, browser type and versions, screen resolution, time zone selected and the version numbers of some of the software installed on your personal computer 

Your email address, first name, ZIP code and country information that you have stored in a Gator ServWareApp is updated on our servers whenever you change this information. To ensure that we and our third party service providers can deliver special offers and advertising we can also collect, store and/or update the email address, first name, ZIP code and country information that is most often used by you to fill out popular web based forms using your computer. Your profile is updated for as long as you are using any Gator ServWareApp so that we can continue to send you special offers and advertising via email. Upon email request to removeinfo@gator.com, we will promptly remove the information that links your email address to the rest of your profile in our online database. Please note that we do not delete information from our back-up copies of earlier versions of our databases; these back-up copies, however, are used solely to recover data that we obtained permission to use that was inadvertently lost due to such things as equipment failure. 

Since each Gator ServWareApp has both a client (software) and server (network) component, Gator.com-controlled servers do communicate with your computer on a regular basis. We use technology that automatically delivers software applications, automatic updates to these applications, and other information to your computer without requiring any action on your part so that they will be ready and waiting for you when you need them. For example, in order for Gator Form Helper to know how to fill out an order form on a web site you visit, it must retrieve the instructions for how to fill out that form from our server. 

Gator.com may occasionally utilize certain rich media viewing/playing applications and/or browser plug-ins ("Rich Media Player/Viewers") such as those published by Macromedia, Onflow, Microsoft, Real Networks and others in order to include audio and visual effects such as animation, video and sound. Gator.com may install certain Rich Media Player/Viewers, which may be required to view such content. Please note that these Rich Media Player/Viewers are third party technologies and may be subject to third party license agreements, privacy policies and other terms and conditions. Visit http://www.gator.com/richmediaapps for a list of current rich Media Player/Viewers used by Gator.com and links to their respective policies. 
Gator ServWareApps may also include price comparison technology powered by Click-the-Button ("Gator Price Helper"). Visit http://www.gator.com/servwareapps for a list of current Gator ServWareApps and links to their respective policies. 

Things Gator.com and partners don't need to know about you. 
The following information is not stored on Gator.com servers unless you request us to do so by registering for optional services: your last name, street addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers and login IDs/passwords for web sites which Gator Login Helper remembers for you. And the basic information that we do store on our servers (specified above) is physically locked up and firewalled for safety. 

In the future, we may offer new services to you in exchange for providing additional information, such as your full name and mailing address, on a strictly opt-in basis. In that event, we would store this information on Gator.com servers and also use this information to select and deliver special offers and advertising to you. In some cases acceptance of a special offer will require that Gator.com provide some of your personal information to a third party, which will be done only with your consent. 

Except as described herein, Gator.com will not transfer or sell any personally identifiable information about you to any third party without your express permission. Please be aware that we sometimes use third party contractors who are given access to your profile to perform tasks that might otherwise be done by Gator.com employees. However, these third parties have no rights to use our information for purposes other than those described herein and they are subject to the same restrictions as Gator.com employees. We will also disclose information to a third party if legally required to do so. 

Gator.com does share non-personally identifiable or aggregate information about where our users surf on the web. For example, we might tell a merchant that we have 50,000 Gator ServWareApp users who buy books. But we would not disclose personally identifiable information about an individual shopper to that merchant. This guarantees that we can obtain great offers for you while respecting your privacy. 

Changes to the Gator.com Privacy Statement and End User License Agreement 
When we automatically deliver and/or update Gator ServWareApps it is likely that we will have to make changes to the Gator.com Privacy Statement and End User License Agreement from time to time. If so, we will provide you with notice either by displaying an online pop-up communication or sending an email message. It is possible that in some cases we might require that you actively "accept" the new Gator.com Privacy Statement and/or End User License Agreement in order to continue using certain Gator ServWareApp applications. We will also continue to prominently publish the current Gator.com Privacy Statement and End User License Agreement on our web site and will make it accessible whenever possible through the Help button displayed in a Gator ServWareApp. If the Gator.com Privacy Statement or End User License Agreement changes in the future, we will not - without your permission - use the personal information that we previously received from you in a manner that is materially inconsistent with the Gator.com Privacy Statement and End User License Agreement that was in effect when the information was collected. Finally, in the event Gator.com sold substantially all of its assets to a third party, we would transfer your information to that party; however, that purchaser would be bound by the Gator.com Privacy Statement and End User License Agreement applicable to the Gator ServWareApps operating on your computer - just as Gator.com is. 

Cookies. 
A cookie is a small file, often containing an anonymous unique identifier.  Cookies can be sent to your browser from another computer and stored on your computer's hard drive, or they can be generated by a Gator ServWareApp and stored on your computer. 

Each server in communication with your computer can store and read only it's own cookie.  You can change your browser settings to disable cookie functionality.  (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preference).  In order to enable certain third parties to display targeted advertisements for Gator.com on some of the web pages you view, Gator ServWareApps may read the cookie information that those third parties stored on your computer and send that information to our servers so that we can include it in advertisement display request that we send to those third parties.  Gator.com uses cookies for the following purposes: 
- To identify the partner that was responsible for introducing you to a Gator ServWareApp application so that Gator.com can pay that partner a fee for introducing you 
- To display the most appropriate advertising based on your interests and activities.  
- To identify which Gator ServWareApps are on your computer

Please note that Gator.com may allow third-party service providers to deliver special services to Gator ServWareApp users and to set and access their cookies on your computer. When these companies set and access their cookies on your computer they do so in accordance with their own privacy policies. Visit http://www.gator.com/servwareapps to view a list of third-party service providers with whom Gator.com currently has relationships - along with links to their privacy policies. 

Web Beacons. 
Web beacons are electronic images (also called a "single-pixel GIF") found in, among other places, various size pop-up advertisements and email messages.  Gator.com and third-party service providers may include web beacons in an email message in order to count and record how many recipients have viewed the email message, in the aggregate, and to individually identify and record, by email address, those who have viewed the email message and those who have not viewed the email message.  Third party service providers that serve ads to Gator ServWareApps users at Gator.com's request may use web beacons in connection with the provisioning of their services.

Optional surveys. 
During registration, Gator.com may ask you for optional demographic information such as gender and income. And, later on, you may be requested to answer optional surveys. If you answer these, we may store your responses in your profile and use it to help us bring you even more relevant information and offers. Any ideas or inventions that you disclose to us through surveys will be used, or not used, by Gator.com at Gator.com's sole discretion; and, Gator.com will have no obligation to you regarding any ideas or inventions that you disclose through such means.

Email.  
Gator.com will send you a welcome message when you first install Gator as well as a periodic newsletter. We may also send you special offers and/or ask you to participate in a survey. 

If you don't want to receive our emails you'll find simple directions for unsubscribing from our periodic newsletters and special offer emails in every message you receive from us. We reserve the right to contact you, however, with non-commercial Service Alert emails in case of critical events such as changes or updates to our software or material changes to this Privacy Statement. 

Other means of communicating with us
We create various means for you to communicate with us.  For example, we may prompt you to answer a survey if you uninstall a ServWareApp.  Another example might include your linking to Gator.com Customer Service through a Gator ServWareApp.  In any event, we use these means of communicating with you to collect information about you.  In the case of customer support questions we use the information to help diagnose and address consumer questions and to respond to you, if we so choose. In the case of surveys, we may use your email address to contact you to follow-up on something you may have communicated.  We do not combine this information with any other of your information that we may have.  Any suggestions, ideas or inventions that you disclose to us through any of these means will be used, or not used, by Gator.com at Gator.com's sole discretion; and, Gator.com will have no obligation to you regarding any ideas or inventions that you disclose through such means.

If you have specific questions regarding the terms of this Privacy Statement contact us at privacy@gator.com.  For all other support questions contact us at support@gator.com. 

 --- Gator.com End User License Agreement ---

What follows is also a large section that is called an End User License Agreement. This is about export controls and ownership of the software and technology and other stuff. We tried to write it in the plainest English possible and we encourage you to read it carefully. 

End User License Agreement ("Agreement") 

By continuing to use Gator ServWareApps and select third-party software and services distributed by Gator.com you agree to the following terms and conditions which succeed those terms and conditions to which you had been previously bound. Unless stated otherwise, any new products or services we provide or distribute, whether through our web site or servers, or through third-party web sites or servers, are also subject to these terms and conditions. 

Scope of License. Gator.com and third-party software and service providers grant to you a non-exclusive, limited license, pursuant to the terms hereof, to (a) install and use the most current versions of Gator.com and third-party software and services solely for the purpose of accessing the Gator.com and third-party provided services and software applications available through our web site or servers, or the web sites and servers of our business associates, and (b) use Gator ServWareApps for your personal, non-commercial purposes. For purposes of the Gator Privacy Statement and End User License Agreement, reference to "Gator ServWareApps" refers to Gator.com and select third-party software and services brought to you by Gator.com. 

License Restrictions. Your license to an existing version of a Gator ServWareApp application may, at Gator.com's discretion, expire when new versions of that Gator ServWareApp application are released. Gator.com reserves the right to add additional features or functions to existing Gator ServWareApp application, or to add new applications to the Gator ServWareApps suite, at any time. When installed on your computer, all Gator ServWareApp applications communicate with the Gator.com or third-party servers periodically. Additionally, Gator.com may require the update or automatic distribution of Gator ServWareApp applications on your computer when a new version of the Gator.com ServWareApp application is released to the general public, when new features are available, to deliver promotional offers, and/or to add new applications to the applications that comprise Gator ServWareApps. This update or new download may occur automatically or through other means. You understand that Gator.com and/or one of our business associates may require your review and acceptance of Gator.com's or their then current Privacy Statement before you will be permitted a limited license to any subsequent versions of Gator ServWareApp applications. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Gator.com and its business associates have no obligation to make available to you any subsequent versions of Gator ServWareApp applications. You may not distribute or copy (other than for backup purposes) Gator ServWareApps. You may not modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise discover or disassemble Gator ServWareApp equivalent of Gator ServWareApps in any way. You do not have the right to create derivative works of Gator ServWareApps, and you agree not to attempt, or allow others to attempt, to reverse engineer Gator ServWareApps and/or modify Gator ServWareApps source code. Any and all such modifications or enhancements to Gator ServWareApps by you, Gator.com, or Gator.com business associates remain the sole property of Gator.com or its business associate. You further agree not to access Gator.com or Gator.com business associate services or software application by any means other than the interface provided by Gator.com or such business associate to access the relevant service. You understand that Gator.com, in its discretion, may modify or discontinue or suspend your right to access any of services at any time. 
Gator.com reserves all rights in Gator ServWareApp applications not expressly granted to you in this Agreement. 

Other Restrictions. You may not rent, lend, assign, or lease a Gator ServWareApp, but you may transfer your rights under Gator's End User License Agreement on a permanent basis provided (i) you transfer all copies of the Gator ServWareApp and Gator's Privacy Statement and End User License Agreement; and (ii) the recipient agrees to be bound to Gator's Privacy Statement and End User License Agreement. Any transfer must include the most recent product upgrade. Prior to transferring a Gator ServWareApp you must remove all copies of the product from your machine. 

Ownership. You agree that each Gator ServWareApp application is licensed, not sold to you. You agree that Gator ServWareApps belong to Gator.com, including all intellectual and proprietary rights, unless otherwise specified. Gator.com and/or Gator.com's third party service providers retain all right, title and interest in and to Gator ServWareApps at all times, and regardless of the form or media in or on which the original or other copies may subsequently exist. In addition, all content accessed through Gator ServWareApps is the property of the applicable content owner and may be protected by applicable intellectual property laws. This Agreement gives you no rights to such content. 

Voluntary Software and Right to Uninstall. You understand that Gator ServWareApp applications, like Gator and OfferCompanion, are voluntary software programs, and you may uninstall either or all of them at any time by using the windows add/remove programs function. However, by uninstalling all Gator ServWareApps, you will be unable to access Gator.com and/or select third-party services. Please note that uninstalling any Gator ServWareApp does not uninstall any Rich Media Player/Viewers described above. 

Your Obligations. You represent and warrant that you are the owner of the computer that you have caused a Gator ServWareApp to reside on, or the owner of the computer that you have caused a Gator ServWareApp to reside has granted you all rights and permissions to do so. You agree, with respect to all other users of the computer that you have caused a Gator ServWareApp to reside, to (i) provide a copy of this Privacy Statement and End User License Agreement to them; and (ii) obtain their consent to Gator's Privacy Statement and End User License Agreement before allowing them to use the computer to surf the Internet. You agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as requested in our registration and account forms and to maintain and update that information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. You agree to not misrepresent your identity or to provide any false information that is requested as part of the service. You agree not to use the service to conduct any business or activity or solicit the performance of any activity, which is prohibited by law, or any contractual provision by which you are bound. You agree to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in connection with the Service.

Links. Gator Supplied Materials may contain links to web sites operated by other parties. The linked web sites are not under the control of Gator.com, and Gator.com is not responsible for the content available on any other Internet sites linked to our Web Site. Unless otherwise stated, such links do not imply Gator.com's endorsement of material on any other web site, and Gator.com disclaims all liability with regard to your access to such linked web sites.

Unless otherwise set forth in a written agreement between you and Gator.com, you must adhere to Gator.com's linking statement as follows: (i) any link to Gator.com's Web Site must be a text only link clearly marked "Gator.com Web Site", (ii) the appearance, position and other aspects of the link may not be such as to damage or dilute the goodwill associated with Gator.com's names and trademarks, (iii) the link must "point" to the URL www.Gator.com and not to other pages within the Gator.com Web Site, (iv) the appearance, position and other attributes of the link may not create the false appearance that your organization or entity is sponsored by, affiliated with, or associated with  Gator.com, Inc., (v) when selected by a user, the link must display the Gator.com Web Site on full-screen and not within a "frame" on the linking web site, and (vi) Gator.com reserves the right to revoke its consent to the link at any time and in its sole discretion. 

Termination. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by uninstalling and destroying all copies of all Gator ServWareApp applications in your possession or control. 

Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL GATOR.COM, ITS EMPLOYEES, DISTRIBUTORS, SUPPLIERS, MERCHANT PARTNERS (INCLUDING ONFLOW INC. AND CLICK-THE-BUTTON), ADVERTISERS, DIRECTORS OR AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY "PROTECTED PARTIES") BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT DAMAGES OR OTHER RELIEF ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES INCLUDING, BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION AND NOT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOST BUSINESS OR LOST OPPORTUNITY, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES, ARISING OUT OF SUCH USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, SERVICE OR WEBSITE, EVEN IF A PROTECTED PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY. IN NO EVENT WILL PROTECTED PARTIES MAXIMUM CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AVERAGE REVENUE RECEIVED BY GATOR.COM PER GATOR SERVWAREAPP USER PER MONTH AS CALCULATED BY GATOR.COM MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF COMPLETE MONTHS YOU HAVE BEEN A GATOR SERVWAREAPP USER. 
Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, Gator.com's liability shall be limited to the extent permitted by law. 

No Protected Parties Liability. Protected Parties assume no liability hereunder for, and shall have no obligation to defend you or to pay costs, damages or attorneys' fees for, any claim based upon: (i) any method or process in which a Gator ServWareApp application may be used by you; (ii) any results of using a Gator ServWareApp application; (iii) any use of other than a current unaltered release of a Gator ServWareApp application; or (iv) the combination, operation or use of any Gator ServWareApp application(s) furnished hereunder with non-Gator.com programs or data if such infringement would have been avoided by the combination, operation, or use of the Gator ServWareApp application(s) with other programs or data. 

Export Controls. Gator ServWareApps and the underlying information and technology may not be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported (i) into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Iraq, Libya, Yugoslavia, North Korea, Iran, Syria or any other country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders. By downloading or using Gator ServWareApps, you are agreeing to the foregoing and you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list, and that you will otherwise comply with all applicable export control laws. 

Applicable Law. Gator.com operates our web site, provides our services, and distributes Gator ServWareApp applications from our offices in California, USA. The laws of the State of California will govern this Agreement, without reference to conflicts of law principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement. 

Arbitration. Any claim or controversy arising out of or related to this Agreement, or the products or services we provide and/or distribute shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any such claim or controversy shall be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated with a claim of any other party. The foregoing shall not preclude Gator.com from seeking any injunctive relief for protection of Gator.com's intellectual property rights. 

Successor Agreements. The terms of this Gator.com End User License Agreement and/or the Gator.com Privacy Statement and/or the privacy statement of select third parties for whom we distribute applications may change in the future.  Gator.com will encourage our third party business associates to inform you in the event changes to their privacy statements are made.  With respect to changes to the Gator.com Privacy Statement or End User License Agreement, and assuming that Gator.com has a current and effective email address for you, Gator.com may provide to you an email notice informing you that changes have been made to the documents and will provide you either with an active link, or inactive URL address, that you can use to view a web page containing the revised documents (or leading you to the appropriate documents).  On other occasions, Gator.com may provide you with an on-line pop-up window notice informing you that changes have been made to the documents and will provide you either with an active link, or inactive URL address, that you can use to view a web page containing the revised documents (or leading you to the appropriate documents). If you have opted out of receiving optional Gator email communications you may still get this notification via a Service Alert email. Gator.com will always post the most current Gator.com Privacy Statement and End User License Agreement on the Gator.com web site that can be accessed at http://www.gator.com/help/privacy.html. 
You agree that after receipt of such change notice, that you consent to the Gator.com Privacy Statement and End User License Agreement unless you affirmatively indicate to Gator.com by email that you do not accept the successor Agreement and remove all Gator ServWareApps from your computer. Failure to remove all Gator ServWareApps from your computer will be deemed an acceptance of the terms of the most current Gator.com Privacy Statement and End User License Agreement. Except as provided in this section, this Agreement may not be revised except in writing signed by all relevant parties. 

U.S. Government Restricted Rights. Gator ServWareApps are provided with Restricted Rights.

General. This Agreement, as modified from time to time as described above, and including the policies incorporated by reference, sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and Gator.com with respect to the subject matter hereof. If any provision or provisions hereof shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be in any way affected or impaired thereby. Gator.com shall not be liable for any delay or failure in performance under this Agreement or interruption of service resulting from acts of God, civil or military authority, war, labor disputes, materials provided by third parties, or any cause beyond the reasonable control of Gator.com. You may not assign this Agreement without our consent.
