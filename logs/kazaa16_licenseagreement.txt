Functionality

SaveNow shows users relevant contextual information and offers as they surf the Web. There are a vast number of  offers and services available to Internet users that SaveNow may display.   In addition, WhenU.com negotiates exclusive offers to maximize value for SaveNow users.  SaveNow's goal is to show users information about these offers and services - right at the moment when they need it.  SaveNow's offers and information are provided to users by showing a limited number of relevant ads in the form of interstitials ("pop-up ads") and other ad formats.  These offers and ads are shown when users visit various sites across the Internet, based on URLs visited by the user and/or search terms typed into search engines and/or the HTML content of the page viewed by the user.  SaveNow's offers are delivered independently from the site the user happens to be visiting when they see a SaveNow offer and are not endorsed or affiliated with anyone other than SaveNow.
