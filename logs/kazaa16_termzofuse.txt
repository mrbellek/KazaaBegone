Cydoor END USER AGREEMENT

The software program you are about to install is an "adware" program, meaning that we have partnered with Cydoor Technologies to deliver small ads to the main window of the application, in order for KaZaA to bring targeted advertising. The software will display web content such as banner ads, e-commerce offers, news headlines and other value-added content. Cydoor Technologies created this technology, and provides it to software developers to implement in software programs. In turn, software developers choose to display ads so that you can enjoy their products for FREE, and they can still earn revenue from advertising.

How does it work?
The Cydoor component of this software is simply a caching mechanism, which stores ads on your hard drive, and displays them only while the software program is open. When the ads have expired, the component deletes old ads and contacts Cydoor's servers in order to receive new ones. To do this, the Cydoor component uses your Internet connection, which was designed to take up the minimum bandwidth on your line. Each ad banner on your hard disc is about 10Kbytes.
 
Finally, Cydoor Technologies, wants you to feel comfortable using this software. Be assured that respecting and maintaining your privacy is KaZaA and Cydoor's top priority ethically and legally. If you have any questions or concerns, please visit the Cydoor website, www.cydoor.com, where you can review its privacy statement.
