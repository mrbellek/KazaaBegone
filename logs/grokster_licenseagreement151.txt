Legal Notice and Terms of Service for Grokster

The software program you are about to install is an "adware" program, meaning that we have partnered with Cydoor Technologies to deliver small ads to the lower left corner of the main window of the application, in order for Grokster to bring targeted advertising to you. These ads will display web content such as banner ads, e-commerce offers, news headlines and other value-added content.  Cydoor Technologies created this technology, and provides it to software developers to implement in software programs.  In turn, software developers choose to display ads so that you can enjoy their products for FREE, and they can still earn revenue from advertising.  

How does it work?

The Cydoor component of this software is simply a caching mechanism, which stores ads on your hard drive, and displays them only while the software program is open.  When the ads have expired, the component deletes old ads and contacts Cydoor's servers in order to receive new ones. To do this, the Cydoor component uses your Internet connection, which was designed to take up the minimum bandwidth on your line. Each ad banner on your hard disc is about 10Kbytes.
 
Finally, Cydoor Technologies wants you to feel comfortable using this software.  Be assured that respecting and maintaining your privacy is Grokster and Cydoor's top priority ethically and legally. If you have any questions or concerns, please visit the Cydoor website, www.cydoor.com, where you can review its privacy statement. 

During installation, we will update your search button in IE to Search Gateway,
in order to provide you with super fast & accurate search results.

We do not want child pornography on the Grokster Network. You should report any incidents to one of the non-profit organizations dedicated to fight the spread of child pornography. One such organization is at www.cybertipline.com. You can find a list of such organizations on http://www.meldpunt.org/NL/inhope.html. 

PLEASE OBSERVE THAT, IN ADDITION TO BEING DISGUSTING, SPREADING CHILD PORNOGRAPHY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE IN MOST COUNTRIES. IF YOU SHARE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, YOU RUN THE RISK OF BEING PROSECUTED, FINED OR IMPRISONED. A number of non-profit organizations and individuals are actively seeking out child pornography on the Internet and reporting the incidents to the authorities. 

7. Grokster's Copyright Infringement Policy 

Grokster respects and wants to protect the rights of copyright owners. We ask all users to pay special attention to avoid violating copyright laws and regulations. Unauthorized copying, distribution, modification, public display, or public performance of copyrighted works is an infringement of copyright holders' rights. You should be aware that some of the files other Grokster users designate to share may have been created or distributed without the copyright owners' authorization. Your license to use the Grokster software and access the Grokster Service is subject to the condition that you shall not infringe the intellectual property rights of others in any way. Grokster will terminate the account of any Grokster users with repeat copyright infringements. Please refer to the Grokster's Repeat Copyright Offender Policy (as set forth below). 

Grokster reserves the right to unilaterally terminate the account of any person (a) upon any single act of infringement in conjunction with the use of Grokster, (b) if Grokster in its sole discretion believes that person's conduct is harmful to the interests of Grokster, other Grokster users, or other Grokster affiliate partners, or (c) for any other reason in Grokster's sole discretion, with or without cause. 

If you are a copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of one and find that a Grokster user is infringing your copyright work, please make contact with us directly at abuse@Grokster.com.

Grokster is technically not able to monitor the information users transmit or store via the Grokster network. Even if Grokster were in the position to monitor the information users transmit or store, which it is not, Grokster is not obliged under law to conduct such monitoring. To the contrary, monitoring users in any communications network would amount to an infringement of their privacy. We, however, are required by law, to comply with requests by judicial authorities for information about our users, in accordance with national legislation to safeguard national security, defense, and public security and for the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal and civil offences. 

8. Grokster's Repeat Copyright Offender Policy 

Grokster will terminate the accounts of users who violate copyrights or other intellectual property rights of third parties if we receive "actual knowledge" of their infringing activities. "Actual knowledge" means a ruling from a judge stating that the user has infringed copyrights or other intellectual property rights. Those users deemed "repeat offenders" by Grokster will have their Grokster account permanently cancelled. Our repeat offender policy is as follows: 

If any Grokster user who has been the subject of a complaint from or on behalf of a content owner that submits a detailed letter in writing stating a name and sufficient facts of repeat copyright infringement, we shall contact directly the user asking either (a) to stop violating copyright laws or (b) file a counter-argument in case the user feels that one has been unrightfully accused. 

If the repeat copyright offender does not reply in writing within 48 hours after our notification, we shall permanently terminate the account without prior notice. 

If the repeat copyright offender chooses not to comply, the copyright holder may sue the offender for copyright infringement directly. 

Any Grokster user who has had its account terminated shall not be permitted to re-register to Grokster at any time. 

Each Grokster user is allowed to have only one active registration or account at any given time. Any Grokster user found to have more than one active registration or account at any time shall have all their Grokster accounts permanently cancelled. 

Grokster will enforce this policy to the extent it is technically feasible to do so. 

In the event that a court of law holds that a Grokster user eliminated from Grokster under this policy did not in fact infringe another's rights or otherwise violate the law, Grokster may re-institute such person's account, upon receipt of the applicable court judgment or order.
